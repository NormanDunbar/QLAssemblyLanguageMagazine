\chapter{This eMagazine is now on Github}
As of a few days/weeks/months or even years ago, depending on when you read this, the source code for the magazine\footnote{But not \emph{yet} the sources for the listings.} can be found on \href{https://github.com/NormanDunbar/QLAssemblyLanguageMagazine}{https://github.com}.

If you go there (by clicking the link above) then you will find all the previous issues, except for the first one. That one was created using a different system very unlike the current system, and I have not yet converted it to use latex. Maybe one day I will - time permitting.

Hopefully, I'll get the source code for the various listings explained in the eMagazine, up there soon too.


Have fun.
