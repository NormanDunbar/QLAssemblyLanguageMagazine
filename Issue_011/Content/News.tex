\section{Beginners Corner}

In Beginners Corner this time, we take a look at simple file and screen
handling. The code to open a text file and to display it on screen
is provided with explanations in excruciating detail!

Buffer overruns are handled safely and without affecting the program's
output. EOF is a little more tricky in Assembly than in S{*}BASIC,
and this is -- hopefully -- well explained too.

\section{Sudoku Solver}

In this issue, the main article is all about solving Sudoku puzzles
using the QL and Assembly Language. This demonstrates recursion and
backtracking and uses a brute force ``algorithm'' to solve the puzzles. 

Well, I say ``solve'' but in reality, it stuffs a number into the
first blank cell it finds, and then tries, recursively, to solve the
new puzzle which has one less blank cell! There's no finesse about
it, it just hammers away until it -- eventually -- solves the puzzle,
or doesn't if the puzzle can't be solved.

\section{The QL Wiki}

For some time now, there has been a problem uploading and/or including
graphics on the \href{https://qlwiki.qlforum.co.uk/}{QL Wiki}\footnote{https://qlwiki.qlforum.co.uk}
in that sometimes it works, but on others, it barfs with an ``Error
403, Forbidden'' message. This affects me as well, and I have administrator
privileges on the Wiki.

Investigations are ongoing, and sadly, have been for quite some time.
We are of the opinion that the host company has done something and
barfed things for the Wiki. Rob Heaton is attempting to get some form
of support out of the hosts, but so far, this is proving quite elusive,
unfortunately.

This is not a good state of affairs to be in, but at the moment, we
are working on it as best we can, given the limitations of the hosts.
They did apparently resolve it a while back, but it has reared its
ugly head once again, but this time, we seem to have stumped them.

If you are trying to insert images into your Wiki pages, and are suffering
from this problem, please be patient. There is a \href{https://qlforum.co.uk/viewforum.php?f=26}{Wiki Topic}\footnote{https://qlforum.co.uk/viewforum.php?f=26}
on the QL Forum where you can report problems with images. Just to
keep prodding us admin types!
