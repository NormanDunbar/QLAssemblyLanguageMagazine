\section{QDOS Companion}

Derek Stewart has scanned Andy Pennell's \emph{QDOS Companion} book
and made it available as a PDF file. Andy gave his blessing to this,
in case anyone is worried about copyright. There's a thread on the
QL Forum, \href{https://qlforum.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=4137}{here}\footnote{https://qlforum.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=12\&t=4137},
which you can follow for updates and corrections etc.

Derek has produced a PDF file containing the book, in as near to its
original, format as possible, and the source code is also available
as a plain Libre Office ODF file, in case you wish to add corrections
and regenerate your own PDF file.

Files can be downloaded from the Sinclair QL account on GitHub, \href{https://github.com/SinclairQL/QDOS-Companion}{here}\footnote{https://github.com/SinclairQL/QDOS-Companion}.
To do so, simply click on the file you want to download, then click
the ``download'' button on the screen that appears next. If you
are after the PDF, don;t wait for it to display,. just click the button
-- it doesn't need to display to be downloaded.

A number of corrections have been made to the book already.
