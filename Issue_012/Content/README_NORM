Changes for this issue and onwards:

1. DONE: Use SMSQ/E trap names etc. Do we need a header file or
   just use the ones we need? Note that the SMSQ names use
   a dot, not an underscore. Do we need both?

2. ONGOING: Beginner's Guide to SMSQ/E traps/vectors etc.

3. TODO: QMAC/QLINK/QMAKE tutorial.

4. TODO: Assembler Workbench ditto?

5. TODO: GWASL/GWASS ditto?

6. TODO: Expression evaluator?

7. DONE: Revisit the maths stack stuff where A1 is discussed 
   (EBook, chapter 7.8). We know it is acurate on QDOS JS, but 
   how about Minerva (uSQLx) JM? and what about SMSQ? Show the 
   code used to write a function taking no parameters, one 
   parameter, two parameters, and what is the value of A1 on 
   entry to:

    * Print myFunc(...).
    * Print 10 * myFunc(...).
    * Print myFunc(...) * 123.

    Where (...) is the appropriate number of parameters.

    If A1 is minus, on entry, the this is the amount of space 
    used so far, and corresponds to 10 * myFunc(...).
    
    If A1 is zero, it's the second and/or third option and no 
    space is used on the stack so far.
    
    If A1 is positive, it's the space available on the stack 
    before BV_CHRIX/????? will cause the stack to move.
