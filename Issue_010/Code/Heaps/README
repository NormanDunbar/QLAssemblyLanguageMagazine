The examples in this directory are fragments only, they are not
a fully working example I'm afraid. They were written to be run
under QMON2 so that I could test the Technical Manual's advice 
about what was returned and where.

As it turned out the docs didn't mention that the size of the 
allocated space returns by the Commmon Heap code includes the 
header block in the size.

I was also unaware that the User Heap stuff takes it's header 
block out of your requested allocation!

Cheers,
Norm.
