Changes for this issue and onwards:

1. Use SMSQ/E trap names etc. Do we need a header file or
   just use the ones we need? Note that the SMSQ names use
   a dot, not an underscore. Do we need both?

2. Beginner's Guide to SMSQ/E traps/vectors etc.

3. QMAC/QLINK/QMAKE tutorial.

4. Assembler Workbench ditto?

5. GWASL/GWASS ditto?

6. Parser/Compiler? (See number 7!)

7. Utility to convert equates and such like from QDOS to SMSQ 
   which should replace explicit equates, insert missing ones,
   where the QDOS ones are automatic (GWASL/GWASS). Look for:

    QDOS_NAME equ $00
    ...
    moveq[.L] #QDOS_NAME,D0
    move[.Size] #QDOS_NAME,D0
    ...
    move.w QDOS_NAME,An

    Lookup table? Maybe, maybe not.

    dc.w Length of each entry
    dc.b 'ENTRY_0','ENTRY_1',...

    Have separate tables for different lengths.

    extract label, get length, use that table, find entry,
    then what? How to replace it?

    If SMSQ name is smaller than QDOS name, add spaces,
    If larger, remove spaces? [OPTIONAL]
