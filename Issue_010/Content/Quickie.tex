What's the fastest way to clear a data register from whatever value
it has, to zero? \texttt{Moveq \#0,Dn} do you think? Maybe \texttt{clr.l
Dn}? Let's see. The timings are taken from the Motorola Semiconductor's
MC68000 Programmers Reference Guide, 4th Edition, Appendix E.

Table \ref{tab:Clearing-a-data-register} shows a few instructions
which can clear a data register and their timings.

It appears that two instructions are quickest. \texttt{Moveq}, as
its name suggests but also moving data from one register to another,
assuming of course that the source register is indeed already cleared.
