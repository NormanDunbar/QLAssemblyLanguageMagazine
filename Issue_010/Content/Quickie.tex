\section{Speedy Stuff}

What's the fastest way to clear a data register from whatever value
it has, to zero? \texttt{Moveq \#0,Dn} do you think? Maybe \texttt{clr.l
Dn}? Let's see. The timings are taken from the Motorola Semiconductor's
MC68000 Programmers Reference Guide, 4th Edition, Appendix E.

Table \ref{tab:Clearing-a-data-register} shows a few instructions
which can clear a data register and their timings.

\begin{table}[!h]
\begin{centering}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline 
\textbf{Instruction} & \textbf{Clock Cycles}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
\texttt{Move.l \#0,Dn} & 12\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{\textbf{Moveq \#0,Dn}} & \textbf{4}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{Sub.l Dn,Dn} & 8\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{Eor.l Dn,Dn} & 8\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{Clr.l Dn} & 6\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{Andi.l \#0,Dn} & 16\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{\textbf{Move.l Dx,Dn}} & \textbf{4}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{Move.l addr.W,Dn} & 16\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{Move.l addr.L,Dn} & 20\tabularnewline
\hline 
Exg Rn,Dn & 6\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{centering}

\end{table}

It appears that two instructions are quickest. \texttt{Moveq}, as
its name suggests but also moving data from one register to another,
assuming of course that the source register is indeed already cleared.
Now, what about address registers?

Table \ref{tab:Clearing-an-address-register} shows a few instructions
which can clear an address register and their timings.

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{centering}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline 
\textbf{Instruction} & \textbf{Clock Cycles}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\hline 
Exg Rn,Dn & 6\tabularnewline
\hline 
Movea.l \#0,An & 12\tabularnewline
\hline 
Suba An,An & 6\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{\textbf{Move.l Rn,An}} & \textbf{4}\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{Move.l addr.W,An} & 16\tabularnewline
\hline 
\texttt{Move.l addr.L,An} & 20\tabularnewline
\hline 
\end{tabular}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{Clearing an address register\label{tab:Clearing-an-address-register}}
\end{table}

It would appear that clearing an address register is quickest when
you have another register already holding zero, but if not, subtracting
the register from itself is the next quickest option.
