No long after release, I spotted a bug in the randomisation chapter
in Issue 8. On page 49, in \emph{Listing 7.3: Rnd 1 to 6 function
- Part 1}, I had a comment on line 67 which mentioned ``divide by
65536''. That was complete nonsense, as that would have cleared the
high word and not the low word. 

Marcel spotted the error and advised me that the code was clearing
overflow, not dividing. My mistake.

Marcel also spotted something else in the code I had blatantly stolen
from the SMSQ sources.

It appears that the code in the \lstinline!rnd! routine where we
have this extract:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Rnd 1 to 6 function},numbers=none]
rnd
    ...
    mulu    #$c12d,d0           ; HHHH * 49453
    mulu    #$712d,d4           ; LLLL * 28973
	...
    clr.w   d0                  ; HHHH 0000 (Divide by 65536)
	...
\end{lstlisting}

could possibly be a typo! He believes that the code should be calculating
a 32 bit by 16 bit multiplication \textendash{} the expression:

\[
myRandSeed=myRandSeed*\$712D+1
\]

However, it seems to be this instead:

\[
myRandSeed=myRandSeed*\$712D+\left(\left(myRandSeed\&\$F0000\right)*\$5000\right)+1
\]

Why both halves of the 32 bit random seed are not being multiplied
by \$712d is unknown, perhaps the used of \$c12d is a typo, perhaps
it's deliberate to make it more random. Nobody knows!

Thanks Marcel.
